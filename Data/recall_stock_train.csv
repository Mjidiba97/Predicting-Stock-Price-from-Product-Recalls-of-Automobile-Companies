2009-08-04,R/2009/016,ford,FOCUS,RISK OF FIRE,It has been identified that  due to a specification change to the engine cooling fan module  vehicles operated in countries which have high road salt usage during the winter months may experience an increased risk of corrosion build up. In extreme cases  the corrosion can penetrate the electrical circuits and result in overheating. In rare cases the overheating may be sufficient to ignite the cooling fan control module and surrounding wiring whilst the vehicle is parked.,Recalled vehicles will be fitted with a supplementary wiring loom that removes the power to the fan control module when the ignition is switched off. Additionally  a further water shield will be fitted to protect the module against water entry and corrosion build up. ,22325,8C203,FOCUS,,,01/06/2006,25/01/2007,Ford Motor Company,2009-08-04,Ford Motor Company,0.004133486406104687

2015-06-19,R/2015/098,jeep,Grand Cherokee  ,SHORT CIRCUIT MAY OCCUR,It is possible that during the manufacturing process the coating on the Occupant Restraint Control (ORC) printed circuit may not have been applied correctly. If the coating has been applied incorrectly  it can result in lead salts forming  which can cause a resistive short across the ORC module printed circuit board(s). Atmospheric humidity may increase the potential for this condition to occur. Should this occur  then it will cause the airbag warning lamp to illuminate and potentially disable the passive restraint system. Ultimately  this can result in an inoperative passive restraint system (airbag) which could increase the risk of injury in the event of a collision.,Recall all affected vehicles to replace the ORC module.,1069,P67,GRAND CHEROKEE,1C4RJEAG0EC106967,1C4RJFKTXEC402001,25/07/2012,28/06/2014,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,2015-06-19,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,0.009371155239736941
