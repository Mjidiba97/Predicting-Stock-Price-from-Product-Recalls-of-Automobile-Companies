If the brake pipe continues to chafe through  sudden loss of brake fluid could be experienced. Brake fluid loss will illuminate a red warning triangle. Brake fluid loss will ultimately result in extended brake pedal travel combined with reduced braking performance in the corresponding brake circuit  increasing stopping distances. Loss of one braking circuit could compromise vehicle stability and significantly increase the risk of an accident.,Recall the vehicles that are likely to be affected.

2018-01-31,R/2018/014,mazda,RX-8 (SE),FUEL MAY LEAK,On the subject vehicles  the resin fuel pump rings located on the top surface of the fuel tank may deteriorate by heat from the engine and exhaust pipes. Over time  this deterioration could cause the fuel tank to leak which may increase the risk a vehicle fire. The resin fuel pump discharge pipe mounted to the upper part of the fuel pump body (within the fuel tank) may also deteriorate following exposure to heat from the engine and exhaust systems. This deterioration may cause the pipe to crack  creating a fuel leak which could increase the risk of a vehicle fire. Fuel may leak from either the upper surface of the fuel tank and /or the fuel pump discharge pipe. In the worst case this may result in a fuel leak. This in turn could increase the risk of a vehicle fire.,Replacement of the resin fuel pump rings and the fitment of heat insulating pads on the upper surface of the fuel tank  to prevent future deterioration by heat of the engine and exhaust systems. The fuel pump filter body will also be replaced with a modified version in order to address the concern of the deterioration of the fuel discharge pipe.   ,25190,AH022A / AH023A,RX-8,JMZSE******100089,JMZSE******150684,28/07/2003,08/02/2008,MAZDA MOTOR CORP,2018-01-31,MAZDA MOTOR CORP,0.002498844546134093

In the unlikely event of clutch pressure plate fracture  a noise (thud / bang) could be heard from the vicinity of the transmission  in extreme cases resulting in clutch / transmission fragments being released and striking under hood components creating a risk of smoke and fire from the under hood area.,To prevent the repeated heating /cooling events a new calibration has been developed for vehicles fitted with Engine Stop Start feature. The software with the additional feature sets the Instrument panel Wrench light and de-rates the engine performance if prolonged clutch slip is detected. The software feature includes a drive cycle strategy for latching the wrench light and engine performance de-rate if the customer should experience repeated clutch slip events. For vehicles that do not have Engine Stop Start feature an alternative clutch kit has been released.,122199,18S07,MONDEO,WF0EXXWPCEEA25812,WF0FXXWPCFGR84561,01/08/2009,30/06/2016,Ford Motor Company,2018-07-16,Ford Motor Company,0.01021601444646316

The crankshaft sensor cannot process the signal values from the crankshaft transmitter due to an improper firmware level.  The firmware does not compensate sufficiently the temperature gradients and the magnetic field strength of the sensor electronic.  If the crankshaft sensor cannot process the signal values from the transmitter  the Digital Diesel Electronic (DDE) will notice that and change to the emergency operation mode. The emergency mode will be displayed by the check control message engine malfunction.  The driver may notice a rough running engine and a reduced driving power (70%). However  an engine stalling during driving conditions cannot be excluded.,On the affected vehicles the crankshaft sensor will be replaced with a new version.,4025,0013850200     0013860200,2 SERIES,WBA2J92090VC25401,WBA2J92010VG40874,10/05/2018,07/06/2018,BMW,2018-08-20,BMW,0.005314189862583148
